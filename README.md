Selenium Page Object Generator
==============================

A nimble and flexible [Selenium Page Object Model](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) generator to improve [agile testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_testing) [process velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_(software_development)).

Selenium Page Object Generator is an essential tool to improve your workflow. It will generate [Page Object Model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) on active [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) tab with a single click, provided that all of the options and template are configured. The generated Page Object Model will be saved to pre-configured Chrome or Opera download folder.

Selenium Page Object Generator is also available in command line by installing [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) package from [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-page-object-generator).

The template is using [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) expression, a clean logic-less semantic templating language.

This is an early BETA release, it expected to have rough edges, and limited functionality. It currently support 3 different targets: [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), and [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/).

C#: [http://relevantcodes.com/pageobjects-and-pagefactory-design-patterns-in-selenium/#post-5229](http://relevantcodes.com/pageobjects-and-pagefactory-design-patterns-in-selenium/#post-5229)

Robot Framework: [http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#taking-resource-files-into-use](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#taking-resource-files-into-use)

(You need to use Chrome 40+ or Opera 15+ or Node.JS 5.x to try this out)

Installation
-

- Install *node.js* and *npm*. Be sure to have node.js version 6+. On GNU/Linux repositories can be outdated so a simple ```apt-get install``` might not be enough to get the right version. 
- Clone the repo.
- Open a terminal/cdm.
- In the terminal go to the repo directory that you just cloned.
- Run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install
```
 This will install all the necesary modules required on the package.json file. 

Command Line Usage
-
Selenium Page Object Generator accepts the following command line arguments:

```bash
selenium-page-object-generator [options]

  -h, --help                                 Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --version                              Show program's version number and exit.
  -t, --target {cs,java,robotm, groovy}      Generator target
  -n, --name [PageName]                      Page name (no-spaces)
  -d, --destination [DestinationPageName]    Destination page name (no-spaces) (optional)
  -s, --source [source.html]                 Source file
```

Examples
-
To generate Java page object:

```bash
$ node_modules/.bin/selenium-page-object-generator -t java -n MySite -s source.html
```

Development Dependencies
-
You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as a local development dependency. The `npm` package manager comes bundled with all recent releases of `Node.js`.

`npm install` will attempt to resolve any `npm` module dependencies that have been declared in the projectâ€™s `package.json` file, installing them into the `node_modules` folder.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Development
-
To build the sources into corresponding packages, run:

```bash
$ gulp
```

The `/build` folder and `/dist` folder are created. All built files are placed in the `build` folder, and the distribution ready packages are placed in `dist` folder.

Distribution
-
Once the changes are in-place and ready for distribution, update `package.json` with new version, and run:

```bash
$ gulp
```

The `/dist` folder will contain distribution ready packages.
